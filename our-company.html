  <h2 class="headline">Who we are</h2>
  <p class="lead-copy">
    Legacy Creators is a private audit firm. Our focus is simple: identify funds being held by government entities that rightfully belong to private citizens or businesses, verify ownership, and help ensure those funds are returned to the correct party.
  </p>

  <p class="lead-copy">
    Many people never know they’re owed anything. Money can sit in holding accounts for years — untouched — because notices were missed, addresses changed, or the rightful owner wasn’t aware funds existed. After a certain amount of time (dependent upon county), the funds rightfully owed to you "escheats" to the government and becomes unrecoverable. We exist to prevent that money from being lost, absorbed, or otherwise escheating.

        “I ignored calls like this in the past because it always sounded too good to be true. My mom passed, I live in another state, and it all just seemed confusing. This time, I listened. Lenita was patient with me, confirmed the funds were legally owed to my family, and we were mailed just under $95,000 when the process was over. She was GREAT to work with. I’m beyond grateful.”
