  <h2 class="headline">What happens if we’ve contacted you</h2>
  <p class="lead-copy">
    If you received a call, letter, or email from Legacy Creators, it’s because our audit flagged funds that appear to be owed to you (or to your business, or to a family member/estate you’re connected to).
  </p>

  <div class="steps-grid">
    <div class="step-card">
      <strong>Step 1: We reach out</strong>
      We attempt to contact the rightful owner. We will never ask for payment to “check” if you’re owed funds.
    </div>
    <div class="step-card">
      <strong>Step 2: We verify ownership</strong>
      We confirm identity and entitlement so those funds can be released to the correct person — not someone pretending to be you.
    </div>
    <div class="step-card">
      <strong>Step 3: Funds get released</strong>
      After proper verification, funds are disbursed. You receive your money. We are compensated only after successful release.
    </div>
  </div>

  <p class="lead-copy" style="margin-top:16px;">
    That’s it. You are not paying us in advance, you’re not “buying” anything, and you’re not gambling on a possibility. We only move forward once we’ve confirmed that real funds are being held in your name.
