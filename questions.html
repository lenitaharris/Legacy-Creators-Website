  <dl class="faq">

    <dt>Why did you contact me?</dt>
    <dd>
      Our audit of government-held funds shows money that appears to be owed to you (or a business / family member tied to you). 
      We reach out so that those funds don’t go unclaimed.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is this guaranteed?</dt>
    <dd>
      No. We can’t guarantee recovery in every situation. It depends on verification and eligibility. 
      We only continue if real funds are already identified and linked to you.
    </dd>

    <dt>Do I have to pay upfront?</dt>
    <dd>
      No. There are no upfront fees. We are compensated only after funds have been successfully released to you.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is this legal?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes. Audits of government-held funds are lawful. Our role is to confirm rightful ownership and help reunite those funds with the correct person.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why can’t I just do this myself?</dt>
    <dd>
      Most people don’t even know the funds exist. Our team identifies the funds, confirms that you’re the correct recipient, 
      and coordinates the steps needed to have them released to you securely. 
      Clients work with us because they want it handled correctly and confidentially.
    </dd>

    <dt>What do you need from me?</dt>
    <dd>
      Usually basic confirmation information so we can verify you’re the rightful recipient. 
      We’ll tell you exactly what’s needed when we speak with you directly.
    </dd>

    <dt>What if I ignore this?</dt>
    <dd>
      In most situations, the funds escheat to the government and are no longer available to claim. 
      That’s why we make contact when we confirm a match — so the rightful owner has a chance to receive what’s owed to them before time runs out.
