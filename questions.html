  <dl class="faq">

    <dt>Why did you contact me?</dt>
    <dd>
      Our audit of government-held funds shows money that appears to be owed to you (or a business / family member tied to you). 
      We reach out so that those funds donâ€™t go unclaimed.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is this guaranteed?</dt>
    <dd>
      No. We canâ€™t guarantee recovery in every situation. It depends on verification and eligibility. 
      We only continue if real funds are already identified and linked to you.
    </dd>

    <dt>Do I have to pay upfront?</dt>
    <dd>
      No. There are no upfront fees. We are compensated only after funds have been successfully released to you.
    </dd>

    <dt>Is this legal?</dt>
    <dd>
      Yes. Audits of government-held funds are lawful. Our role is to confirm rightful ownership and help reunite those funds with the correct person.
    </dd>

    <dt>Why canâ€™t I just do this myself?</dt>
    <dd>
      Most people donâ€™t even know the funds exist. Our team identifies the funds, confirms that youâ€™re the correct recipient, 
      and coordinates the steps needed to have them released to you securely. 
      Clients work with us because they want it handled correctly and confidentially.
    </dd>

    <dt>What do you need from me?</dt>
    <dd>
      Usually basic confirmation information so we can verify youâ€™re the rightful recipient. 
      Weâ€™ll tell you exactly whatâ€™s needed when we speak with you directly.
    </dd>

    <dt>What if I ignore this?</dt>
    <dd>
      In most situations, the funds escheat to the government and are no longer available to claim. 
      Thatâ€™s why we make contact when we confirm a match â€” so the rightful owner has a chance to receive whatâ€™s owed to them before time runs out.
